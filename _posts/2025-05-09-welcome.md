Alright, this is it - the first blog post! This is exciting and quite frankly quite overdue. My old
website has been online for 11 years without change.

I want a medium to document how I built my home server setup, with a focus on security and
configuration as code. I know, there are plenty of resources out there already discussing this -
still, when I embarked on this journey I quite quickly realised that a proper, "production grade"
setup is rather involved and requires many considerations. I've not found a single source which was
satisfactory and needed to consult many different sources.

And there is the problem, while it is fine to consult many sources, when I come back to my project
after a few days (or weeks) of a break, I often wonder what I've done already, where I left of and
what I changed. So, I need to document the setup somewhere - hence the idea for the blog. I hope you
find this useful.
