I'm a Senior Software Engineer at a FinTech Unicorn. I love engineering and good challenges, hence
I've always plenty of projects going on either concerning computers, electronics or woodworking.
Besides that, I love being outdoors. I've a passion for mountaineering, cycling and packrafting.

I've started this blog to document how I build and configure my home server, with a focus on
security and configuration as code.
